PROJECT GREENLIGHT - Term Life Insurance Conversion Prediction
# Project Greenlight: Term Life Insurance Conversion Prediction

## üîç Overview
**Project Greenlight** is a machine learning initiative designed to help HashSysTech identify which customers are most likely to convert on **term life insurance offers**. The model supports strategic telemarketing outreach by scoring leads based on demographic, behavioral, and campaign interaction data.

This project uses Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers to predict customer conversion (`yes`/`no`) and evaluates models using metrics like **ROC-AUC**, **precision**, and **recall**. The insights support smarter allocation of sales resources and improve campaign efficiency.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset contains 45,211 customer records with features such as:

- `age`: Customer's age
- `job`, `marital`, `education_qual`: Demographic information
- `call_type`, `mon`, `day`, `dur`: Contact info
- `num_calls`, `prev_outcome`: Campaign performance history
- `y`: Target variable (conversion ‚Äî yes/no)

---

## üß† Project Goals
- Build a predictive model for term life insurance conversion
- Evaluate model performance using AUC, confusion matrix, and F1-score
- Identify top features that influence customer conversion
- Visualize insights to support marketing and CRM targeting
